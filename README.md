# Tic-Tac-Toe_AI
An implementation of a tic-tac-toe solver using various AI and Machine Learning algorithms.

### Usage
```
python3 Main.py
```

# Currently Implemented Models
1. Random
2. Tabular Q-Learning

# Planned Models
1. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
2. Neural Network
3. Convelutional Neural Network + MCTS


# Test Results
